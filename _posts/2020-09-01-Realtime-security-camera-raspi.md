 In the previous post I have explained about how to turn your raspberry pi Zero into a music player through bluetooth. However not long after that I discovered another application that is perfect to compliment my pi :) 
 The tutorial explained on how to set up a real-time security camera with raspi and stream it through VNC. That is such an excellent idea to try because streaming will not consume memory space in my Pi !
 I followed all the guides from a tutorial video in YouTube which i will post it here and I can confirm the system works so well and it is streaming in high quality to your laptop. The small RAM in raspi Zero does not affect the quality and the speed of IP camera transmission, I believe the speed is relative to how fast your internet is.

### Tools:
1. Raspberry pi zero W (512 MB RAM). OS: Linux raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit).
2. Power cable, screen, HDMI cable, mouse, keyboard, 16 gb SD card
3. Camera module. I bought this online from Aliexpress.com for about US$ 8.
Though I have to wait for almost a month to arrive, I am super-satisfied with the features this camera offers. It has 5 MP wide angle fish eyes + night vision surveillance lenses 1080p and you can adjust its focus manually by rotating the lens. It also comes with Pi Zero camera adapter cable so you do not need to worry on finding one because it is quite hard to find. This stuff is worth every second moment I opened my post box with hope.
