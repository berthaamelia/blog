I have always loved statistic, it was among my most favorite subject when I did my bachelor and master. In my most recent master thesis, I applied statistical quantitative approach in order to justify the effect of income inequality in entrepreneurial activities in 70 different countries. 
Some people may think it's boring, but I simply adore how one can generate patterns of information solely from a bunch of numbers in a table form. The more you dig into, the more you discover the hidden layers of information underneath. There is no right or wrong, it is just a question of which method would you like to associate your argument with. Perhaps that is what makes it very much captivating, the fact that you could not manipulate details inside statistic? It is so pure and honest. 

Back in university, I normally used SPSS software to run statistical analysis. Now that I don't own any license of it, I challenged myself to use python instead. It is not easy at all obviously, however i believe it is the learning process that matter. Here I would like to share with you my starting journey of statistical analysis with python library in statistic such as statsmodels. Matplotlib and scikit come in handy too, especially to visualize the data. 

### Basic linear regression step-by-step
1. In order to identify any assumption, we must first determine a scenario where our independent variable could potentially impose a positive or negative relationship to our dependent variable. In this case, we want to find such relationship from the trend in a scatter plot. 
2. Camera module. I bought this online from Aliexpress.com for about US$ 8.
Though I have to wait for almost a month to arrive, I am super-satisfied with the features this camera offers. It has 5 MP wide angle fish eyes + night vision surveillance lenses 1080p and you can adjust its focus manually by rotating the lens. It also comes with Pi Zero camera adapter cable so you do not need to worry on finding one because it is quite hard to find. This stuff is worth every second moment I opened my post box with hope.

Basic program requirements:
- VLC media player
- Raspivid (it is by default installed already in your computer)

This is the complete video tutorial video on how to setup the pi:

### Sidenote:
Basically the idea behind this project is to use the raspi as an IP camera and it will stream the video over network by using RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol). Then we will use the raspivid in order to configure the stream setting.
By default it is set to output 1080 video at 30 fps with a bit rate of 2 Mbps. However the setting can be adjusted according to your need, you just need to edit the script `rtsp-stream.sh`.
<br/>Probably the only downside with such system is its limitations to work with captured images, in contrary to OpenCV. The VLC stream only allow you to see real-time images, record videos and few other basic video editing.
Honestly for me this application works like a charm. I mean OpenCV is awesome but that suits to completely another level of application. It optimizes a computer to solve vision problems like face recognition or video analysis. Typical case is to get a license plate number of a car that was speeding, or assigning a robot vision to acknowledge humanâ€™s handwriting. As for day-to-day budget surveillance system, I believe my raspi Zero does fantastic job! Check out how I installed it in my apartment :house: :wink:
